# 2017-assignment-HTML
This was our first class project... I have decided to post it here on github. It was ALREADY SUBMITTED and POINTS AWARDED!
The point though, is, am refurbrishing it to create a Badass website.... Not for my own gain, but for each and every contributer! 
Be sure to go thro every line of code and debug it. 
If we do a good job, i'll pay you guys via PayPal. I PROMISE! 
Av been doing things my own way, how about teamwork this time?
